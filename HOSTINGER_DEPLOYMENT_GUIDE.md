# Hostinger Deployment Guide for Next.js Application

## Deployment Readiness Assessment

### ‚úÖ Configuration Status
Your Next.js application has been configured for static site hosting on Hostinger with the following changes:

- Updated `next.config.js` to use static export mode
- Fixed service worker implementation in `_app.js`
- Restored metadata for proper SEO
- Configured image optimization for static hosting

### üß™ Test Coverage & Quality Assurance
- No automated tests found in the project
- ESLint configuration is present but errors are ignored during builds
- Consider implementing tests before production deployment

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Build Your Application
Run the following commands to build your application:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This will generate a static export in the `out` directory.

### 2. Upload to Hostinger

1. Log in to your Hostinger control panel
2. Navigate to File Manager or use FTP access
3. Upload the entire contents of the `out` directory to your hosting root (public_html)

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Make sure to set up the following environment variables in your Hostinger hosting environment:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`

You can set these in your Hostinger control panel under the Website > Advanced > Environment Variables section.

### 4. Set Up Domain and SSL

1. Configure your domain in the Hostinger control panel
2. Enable SSL certificate for secure HTTPS connections
3. Ensure all redirects point to the HTTPS version of your site

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Deployment Issues

### API Routes Limitations
Since this is a static export, any API routes using Next.js API Routes won't function. Ensure your application:

- Uses Supabase or other external APIs directly from the client
- Doesn't rely on Next.js API routes for critical functionality

### Image Optimization
Next.js Image optimization is disabled for static exports. Consider:

- Pre-optimizing images before deployment
- Using responsive image techniques with standard HTML

### Service Worker Considerations
The service worker is configured to work on non-localhost environments. Verify it works correctly after deployment.

## üöß Post-Deployment Checklist

1. Verify all pages load correctly
2. Test authentication flows with Supabase
3. Confirm all images and assets are loading
4. Check mobile responsiveness
5. Validate form submissions and API interactions

## üí° Performance Optimization Recommendations

1. Enable Hostinger's built-in caching
2. Configure proper cache headers for static assets
3. Consider using a CDN for global performance
4. Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content
